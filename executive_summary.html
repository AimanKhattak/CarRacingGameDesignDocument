	<DL>
	<DT><b><h3>Introduction:</h3></b></DT>	
	<dd>The name of my game is "Car Racing game". It's a first person driving game where the aim is to beat all competitors in races, 
		in order to win prizes such as new cars and money and become the best in the world.
		<br>

      In this game, you are the driver. You are the racer. Each race will have one or two laps. The first player to pass over 
      the finish the line will be crowned winner of the race. The more races you win the more money,
      cars and power you gain. Over time you will build up your reputation and have players want to challenge you for your goods. 
      If the other competitors cross the finish line before you, the game will immediately finish and you will not finish the race and will 
       not gain any prizes</dd>	
	
	<DT><b><h3>Genre:</h3></b></DT>
	<dd>The genre of my game would be classed as a racing simulation. It would be a modern game based around 
		the country side / villages as there is more road available in those areas.</dd>

	<DT><b><h3>Target audience:</h3></b></DT>
	<dd>The target audience of this game would be anyone over the age of 7. This game will not contain violence 
		and will be a fun and competitive game for anyone over the age of seven and for all genders and race and religion. 
		But based on research many of our audience will be males.</dd>

	<DT><b><h3>Scope:</h3></b></DT>
	<dd>The scope of this game is developed by unity 2D.This game idea was suggested by other studentsand refined after talking to lecture.
		This project will be built in Unity(Game Development Tool). This project has a 4 month time restraint.</dd>

	<DT><b><h3>objectives:</h3></b></DT>
	<dd>The objective of the game is to win all the races so you can unlock more cars.</dd>

	<DT><b><h3>Game progressions:</h3></b></DT>

	<dd>When the game starts, a traffic light will change from red to green signaling the start of the
			game and all cars will start going forward. The other two opponent cars are set to have higher
			speeds than the player’s car and one of them is the fastest. The detection of the USB keyboard is
			in a separate thread and the system will be detecting if a key is pressed all the time. When the left
			key is pressed, the player’s car will be moving towards left. When the right key is pressed, the
			player’s car will be moving towards right. If the player’s car collides with the road or other cars,
			its position will be reset to the middle of the road and its speed will be slowed down. If the
			player’s car hits a coin, the score will be added up. When the score is larger than or equal to 5
			and the up key is pressed, the player’s car will speed up. If the distance between the player’s car
			and the opponent cars is within the passing range and the player’s car is still speeding up, the
			player’s car will be passing the opponent cars. If the player’s car is not speeding up and the
			distance is within passing range, the player’s car will be passed by the opponent cars.</dd>

	<DT><b><h3>Rules: </h3></b></DT>
	<dd> The player can either choose to play with a keyboard or a wired controller. The player will use the 
		controller of their choice to navigate through the race track.The track will be made up of four lanes with 2
		going in either direction. A racer can travel in
		any of the lanes. Swiping left or right will swiftly move you
		from one lane to another. You will continue in
		this lane as if on a rail until something acts
		upon you or you choose to move.</dd>

		<DT><b><h3>Combat: </h3></b></DT>
		<dd> Grip is a vehicle combat game that removes the traditional limits of the road from game play. Players use the floor means roads in an 
			attempt to destroy other players.
			 Vehicle models are designed with oversize tires which let the cars drive regardless of their orientation.</dd>

	<DT><b><h3>Story and Background: </h3></b></DT>
	<dd> Real world integration is key – you should have a home ground advantage in the streets you
		know and use every day. Venture further out and test your skills in unfamiliar places close to
		home or around the world at famous landmarks.
		Anticipation leading up to and entering a race against a known or unknown real person is
		intriguing. Defeating them or evading capture can provide a wonderful sense of achievement.
		Hang out with your friends, create a racing club, play for a brief time or a long time? There is
		always something new to discover.
		</dd>
		<DT><b><h3>Levels: </h3></b></DT>
		<dd> Levels will be added after first release of game. As the gamer accomplish the tasks and beat from others
			then goes to the next level which will be difficult than first will be played.
			</dd>
		<DT><b><h3>Location: </h3></b></DT>
		<dd> The racers car will also be
			identifiable visually as being in this
			mode for easy detection by others. The
			Racer will then continue to drive around
			until their challenge is accepted.
			</dd>

		<DT><b><h3>Music & Sound effects: </h3></b></DT>
		<dd> There is a real opportunity with the sound to integrate the diverse types of musical interests into
			the driving experience. Listening to music is an enjoyable past time in the car and it should be no
			different for this Car racing game.
			One opportunity to explore is to create some audio loops that represent diverse types of music,
            from Rap, blues, to rock, to metal to pop. Taking influence from current popular musical trends
            some simple loops will be created that will allow the player to feel like there musical interests
            are being catered for. I would suggest that getting the cool sound track that matches your
            musical style will be important to people who play the game a lot and further for people who like
            to play in groups.
            The music should come in two types, cruising music and pursuit music to match the game modes
            available.<br>
            This music should be audible when you pass by another car.<br>
            The Pursuit mode should have dramatic chase music and sirens to heighten the enjoyment.
